<h1>Drum Kit Simulator</h1>
	<p>
		The goal of this project is to simulate playing a drumkit through programming-based means while still retaining a natural,
		swung sound. This will be accomplished by analyzing user-inputted audio recordings of users drumming on any number of distinct
		surfaces which have unique timbres. Each drum sound hit will then be recognized, isolated, and normalized. Tone and tambre will
		then be recognized by performing clustering analysis on vectors produced via CNN processing of spectograms; each distinct
		surface being hit in the recording will be
		mapped to a virtual, simulated drum. Then, inserting drum samples depending on cluster labelings and recorded-sample amplitudes,
		a new drum track will be created which is able to accurately recreate the recorded demo with respect to both time and dynamic
		emphases.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project is due for completion in early 2022.
