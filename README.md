# DrumKitSim
The goal of this project is to create realistic MIDI drum tracks which are not time-quantized and retain natural dynamic contrast.
This will be accomplished by analyzing user-inputted audio recordings of users drumming on any number of distinct surfaces which have unique timbres. Each drum sound hit will then be recognized, isolated, and normalized. Tone and tambre will then be recognized by performing machine learning on audio samples; each distinct surface being hit in the recording will be mapped to a virtual, simulated drum. Then, the program will insert samples depending on cluster labelings and amplitudes, creating a new drum track.

# Updates
### Mar 25, 2025
Added peak finding algorithm (with ≥80% accuracy in initial tests!)

Using `datasets/snaps.wav`, we can see 5 peaks found for 4 snaps.

Using `datasets/TightSnaps.wav`, we can see, for 7 major sounds, there are 7 peaks. Amazing!

The flams aren't working quite yet, but we can revisit that in the near future. Onto the machine learning!

### Jun 8, 2024
Added rudimentary audio segmentation based on audio above/below amplitude threshold

#### Feb 16, 2022
Gaussian Mixture Model currently performs the best, even before FFT. 
Trials to be run
* Using vs not using FFT
* More GMM
* Soft-clustering techniques
* Different eps for DBSCAN
* Using CNN to process a Mel Spectrogram
